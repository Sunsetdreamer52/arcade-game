merge conflicts and laggy game??
lasers are finally implemented but sometimes the tracer laser doesn't show up, this is totally an intended feature and just tests players' skill in detecting when a ranged enemy has stopped moving and is preparing an attack that just so happens to be hidden. y'know, every now and then an enemy is gonna try to 360 no scope ya boy and hes just gotta be prepared for that day that is now the in lore reason why the tracer doesn't show up the enemy just got a random burst of skill and decided to turn off his targeting controls and fire blindly but the laser still needs charging up so he just sits there silently for a bit then quickdraws and fires in an unpredictable fashion. git gud, he retorts, as the enemy dude turns around and explosions happen behind him. This occurence happens approximately once every 20 laser firings, and usually occurs around the left side of the map. It is also good to note that the code causing this 1 in 20 bug i mean feature is pretty much exactly the same as the full-power laser but with a different width and color. there is currently no reason for this code to act out of line and when found it will be severly punished. reward: my sanity at 3am, dead or alive.
uhh so apparently theres a second compeletely intended feature in which the lasers fire both ways at once very competely intended yes its a test of player skill
